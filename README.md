# in_depth_analysis_of_time_series_data_trends__seasonality_stationarity_autocorrelation
in-depth analysis of financial time series data, offering insights into trends, seasonality, stationarity, and autocorrelation
Data Loading and Preprocessing:
It imports essential Python libraries, such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and statsmodels, for data manipulation and analysis. The code loads a financial dataset from a CSV file named 'Price.csv' using the Pandas library. Data Exploration:

The code creates a copy of the dataset ('df_c') and extracts the 'year' and 'week' information from the 'date' column using Pandas datetime functions. Unnecessary columns ('dax', 'ftse', 'nikkei') are removed from 'df_c' to focus on the 'spx' data. Data Visualization:

The script utilizes the Seaborn library to plot line graphs, showing the trends in the 'spx' data over the years and weeks. It also generates a distribution plot for 'spx' data to visualize its statistical distribution. Time Series Analysis:

The code explores the time series data further by resampling it to business day frequency ('B') and calculating the mean values. Missing values in 'spx', 'dax', 'ftse', and 'nikkei' columns are filled using forward and backward filling methods. The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test is applied to check the stationarity of the 'nikkei' data, and the results are displayed along with a line plot. White Noise Analysis:

White noise data is read from an Excel file ('wn.xlsx'). The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test is applied to assess the stationarity of the 'wn' data, and the results are shown along with a line plot. Seasonal Decomposition:

The code performs seasonal decomposition on the 'ftse' data using both additive and multiplicative models. It visualizes the decomposed components, including trend, seasonal, and residual, for each model. Autocorrelation Analysis:

Autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) plots are generated for 'ftse' and 'wn' data. These plots help in understanding the time dependencies and lags in the data. This code is designed for in-depth analysis of financial time series data, offering insights into trends, seasonality, stationarity, and autocorrelation.
